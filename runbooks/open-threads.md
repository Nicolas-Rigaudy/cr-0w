# Open threads

One note in the vault crow folder: `Open Threads.md` (`bin/crow-state path threads`; `local/state/open-threads.md` only while `vault.crow_dir` is unset). It lists open work by who acts. It stays a plain checkbox list that Obsidian Tasks can read.

## Format
```
## Me
- [ ] 2026-10-22 [project] text → next step
## Crow
- [ ] 2026-11-02 [project] item_047: text → next step
## Waiting
- [ ] 2026-11-02 [project] Person: text → next step
```
- Line shape: `- [ ] YYYY-MM-DD [project] text → next step`. The date is the last touch.
- `## Me`: the owner acts.
- `## Crow`: the hub or a project session acts. Point to the Logics item (`item_047`) when one exists instead of restating it.
- `## Waiting`: someone else acts. The text starts with the person's name, then a colon.
- Moving an item to another actor means moving the line and re-dating it.

## Rules
- Done means gone. A ticked item leaves the file in the same write and is logged with `bin/crow-log "[project] done: text"` (daily note, CR-0W section).
- Never write a status note here. Project state goes to `Status.md`, constraints and decisions to one note each in `Decisions/`.
- Stale: no touch for 14 days (date older than today minus 14). Readers list stale lines and ask keep, re-date or drop. Drop means the line leaves the file.
- One line per item. Update a line in place, never duplicate it.
