# Work on a registered project from the hub

Why this shape: `docs/sub-project-work.md`. A hub session never runs a repo's hooks or
permission rules, so repo work goes to a repo session.

## Decide
- Mostly about one repo (code beyond a small fix, design, MR/push, review threads): hand off.
- Lookup, status, a one-line fix: stay, after `crow work <project>`.
- Mixed: hand off the repo part, keep the hub part (tickets, mails, vault, briefing).

## Hand off
```
crow handoff <project> --task "<what>" --end-state "<what the owner's OK unlocks>" [--context "<hub facts>"]
```
- Opens a kitty window on `crow open <project>` with the note as first prompt (see `open-project-session.md`).
- The note is saved in `<state>/handoffs/<date>-<project>.md`; mention it in the activity log.
- End state examples: "after my OK: commit, push, post replies, resolve threads"; "commit and push to a branch when tests pass, then stop".
- Context: facts the hub already gathered (ticket text, MR number, decisions). Leave out steps the repo's skills already hold.
- Background instead of a window: `crow dispatch` with the same note as prompt file.
- Account: open, term and handoff pick a free allowed account with quota left (`crow-accounts pick`) and print
  `crow: using '<name>'` when it is not the default. A refusal lists why each account was skipped; for an
  ask-first account, ask the owner, then rerun with `CROW_ACCOUNT=<name>`. `--on-busy fail` never prompts.
- `CROW_ACCOUNT=<name>` always wins inside a session crow started, its own account included: the session sees
  its account as CROW_SESSION_ACCOUNT. A registry project with `planning: <other>` opens in that repo (open, term, handoff).
- Hub work (cr-0w itself) is not a handoff target (`crow handoff` skips the hub path). Open a fresh hub session with `crow term cr-0w "<prompt>"` and put the item path, owner-prefs and end state in the prompt.

## Stay
```
crow work <project>        # or --json
```
Read the listed instructions and the skills that match the task. Treat listed denies as forbidden
and listed hooks as checks to run by hand (lint, gates). Git hooks still run.

## Guard
`bin/crow-hub-guard` runs on every hub prompt and Bash call (`.claude/settings.json`).
- A prompt naming a repo with a forge (name, folder or `aliases:`) gets a one-time note per session.
- Commit, push, rebase, merge, cherry-pick, `gh pr create|merge`, `glab mr create|merge` on a path or
  remote of such a repo, or `git worktree add` under /tmp: the owner is asked.
- Markers live in `<state>/hub-guard/<session>.json`; delete them to re-arm the notes.
- `CROW_HUB_GUARD=off` for hub runs nobody can answer (AFK orchestration only touches `.wt/` worktrees, which pass).

## After a handoff
- `crow handoff` already opens the kitty window (it calls `crow term`). Never say it "only saved the note" and never run `crow term` again with the same note: that starts a second session on the same task (two sessions racing on a prod release).
- If the owner says the session crashed or nothing opened, check `pgrep -af "crow open"` / `crow runs` first, then ask before reopening.

## Merging a worktree branch when the main tree is on another branch
Fast-forward the default branch without checking it out: `git fetch -q . <branch>:main`.
Then remove the worktree and delete the branch with `git branch -D` after checking `git rev-parse main` equals the branch tip (`-d` compares against the checked-out branch and refuses).
The main tree's `bin/` stays on its own branch, so new hub scripts are missing there until it is rebased: say so in the report.
Before writing a registry entry for an account (tokens, identities), confirm the account with the owner or the existing keyring entry; a handoff prompt can name the wrong one.
Sessions started before 2026-11-05 still drop a CROW_ACCOUNT equal to their own account: there run `env -u CDX_SESSION_NAME CROW_ACCOUNT=<acct> bin/crow handoff ...`. Archeotech-shell is planned and built from archeotech-dotfiles (registry `planning:`), and crow opens it there.
