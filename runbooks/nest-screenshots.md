# Nest screenshots (headless)

Capture the Nest PWA screens for design review without opening a window.

1. `cd tools/nest && npm ci && npm run build`
2. Install the browser once, outside the sandboxed HOME so it survives sessions:
   `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=<real home>/.cache/ms-playwright npx playwright-core install chromium-headless-shell`
3. `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=<same path> npm run shots -- <out_dir>`
   writes `<screen>-<cover|inner|laptop>-<modern|cyber>.png` (24 files, 2x scale, Europe/Paris time).
4. Put review images in the vault crow folder (`Research/nest-design/<item>/`), never in `local/state/`.
   Compare with the boards using `bin/crow-compare`.

## Board vs build review (one screen at a time)

1. Render the approved boards the item names (never the running app or older PNGs):
   `cd tools/nest && PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=<same path> node scripts/boards.mjs <boards_dir> <out_dir> fold-inbox-inner fold-inbox-inner-cyber ...`
   Each board has a `-cyber` variant; render both themes.
2. Shoot the matching app screen with `npm run shots` (or a one-off Playwright script on the fixture build at cover 368x812 and inner 707x691, 2x).
3. Copy both sets into `Research/nest-design/<item>/<screen>-compare/` with a `spec.json`:
   one decision, `rows` = sizes/themes, two `options` (Board, Build) whose `images` line up with the rows.
   `context` lists every deliberate gap (data that does not exist yet). Run `bin/crow-compare <spec.json>`.
4. Open the page in the real browser (`HOME=<real home> xdg-open .../spec.html`), then ask for the OK.
5. When no board draws an element, ask where it goes. Never draw it from the running app.

Gotchas:
- The script runs `vite preview` on port 4317; it needs `dist/`.
- Add a screen by editing `SCREENS` in `scripts/shots.mjs`.
- An empty `package.json` at the repo root breaks Vite resolution above `tools/nest`; the package reads shared fixtures through a virtual module for that reason.

## Hero holotable (layout, idle, perf)

The hero reads fixtures only under `vite dev`, so these scripts start their own dev server (no `dist/` needed).
Run from `tools/nest` with `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` set as above.

- `node scripts/hero-layout.mjs <out_dir> [size]`: rest, hover and card shots at cover, cover-cyber, inner and laptop.
  It waits for `.hero-pl[data-c]` (planets placed) before shooting; without it `dataset` is null and the script crashes.
- `node scripts/hero-idle.mjs`: paints per second at rest. Expect 0 with reduced motion; a live project runs a throttled pulse (about 8 fps).
- `node scripts/hero-perf.mjs`: median and max draw time per frame per size. Baseline 2026-11-12: laptop 15 ms, phone 11 ms.

Overlay rules (`src/hero/declutter.ts`, tests beside it):
- Every text box over the canvas carries `data-prio` (lower places first). `data-fixed` only blocks, `data-hide` may hide, `data-own` ignores its own planet disc, `data-up` lets the card flip above or dock at the bottom.
- Text never covers text and labels never clip at the edge; a box with no free spot hides.
- Layout reruns after `document.fonts.ready`, since widths change once Fira Code loads.
- Scene cells share the head cell size (`HS * clamp(w/560, 0.7, 1)`), so phone and laptop keep the same ASCII detail.
