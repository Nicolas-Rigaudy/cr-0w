# Overview
crow runs on the Windows tower in WSL Arch and helps manage game mods.

# Goals
- crow works on the tower like on the laptop.
- Game mods are managed from crow with backups.

# Non-goals
- Tower as a mission host (item_120) and local AI benchmarks (req_029): later.
- Homelab services (Syncthing peer, ntfy, aggregator, DNS, media, photos): later, in the homelab repo.
- Shared crow state across machines (req_016 step 4 sync).

# Scope and guardrails
- In: scaffolded request, product, backlog, orchestration task, validation, and handoff context.
- Out: unrelated workflow docs and implementation of generated tasks.

# Key product decisions
- Use structured input as the source of truth for generated docs.
- Keep generated write paths local and repo-bounded.

# Success signals
- Generated docs pass lint and audit without broad manual rewrites.
- Context-pack output can be handed to an implementation agent directly.

# References
- Product back-reference: `req_056_crow_on_the_windows_tower`
- Task back-reference: `task_022_orchestrate_crow_on_the_windows_tower`
