# AI Context
- Summary: a chat in Nest with the butler (CR-0W persona), run by the req_032 engine: one long-lived `claude -p` stream-json process per conversation, core MCP tools only, a core bridge that streams replies to Nest. The butler starts missions first, and sessions or dispatch only when asked.
- Keywords: butler, chat, orchestrator, claude -p, stream-json, mcp, core bridge, nest
- Use when: building the butler conversation or its core bridge.
- Skip when: chat inside one run (item_177), persona text (item_118).

# Problem
- Every request to crow today starts with a terminal hub session. The owner wants to talk to the orchestrator from Nest (2026-11-10). The engine is decided (req_032, owner 2026-11-07) but nothing runs it.

# Scope
- In:
  - Core bridge: start, keep and stop one butler process per conversation; `POST /api/butler/<conv>/say`, replies streamed over SSE (item_146) with a polling fallback; transcript kept in core state; one process idles out after 30 min and resumes from the transcript.
  - Flags per req_032: `--tools "" --strict-mcp-config --allowedTools "mcp__core__*" --permission-mode dontAsk`, on an account allowed by the cdx policy.
  - Core MCP server exposes the item_169 reads and the item_147/170 actions. Missions first: `mission.new` with a kind, then session and dispatch.
  - Any action that needs a tap (confirmation, approval) becomes an inbox item. The butler never confirms for the owner.
  - Persona from item_118 ("Sir", formal and calm).
  - Nest placement (owner 2026-11-12, replaces the 2026-11-10 Home-only plan):
    - Laptop: an always-on butler rail on the right of every screen (about 320px): small hero on top whose mood follows core state (item_158 order fail > ask > run > idle, so it reacts to sessions and runs, not only to the chat), the typed butler line, the transcript, the input. A hotkey folds it to a thin strip (hero head + mood dot). On Home the rail hides its hero; the holotable hero is the full scene.
    - Phone and Fold: no rail. A mini hero badge in the header shows the mood and opens the chat. Home keeps the approved D layout (text box under the holotable, reply in the holotable line).
    - Action chips the butler proposes (tap = the same core action) show in the transcript.
    - First step: render 2-3 rail boards (rail width, folded strip, hero size, Home without duplicate hero, phone badge) and get the owner's pick before any build. The rail footprint also feeds the item_189 side-by-side board.
- Out:
  - Voice. Several parallel butler conversations in the UI (one is enough at first). Butler editing files directly.

# Acceptance criteria
- AC1: "Start a review of api!412" in Nest creates a review mission; the reply links it.
- AC2: "What's running?" answers from the core sections, matching Home.
- AC3: An action that needs approval lands in the inbox; the butler says so and nothing runs before the tap.
- AC4: Closing Nest and coming back an hour later shows the same conversation; the next message continues it.
- AC5: The butler process has no tool outside `mcp__core__*` (checked from its init event).
- AC6: The owner approved rendered rail boards before the build; on the laptop the rail shows on every screen, folds by hotkey, and its hero mood changes when a run starts or a session asks.

# AC Traceability
- request-AC1 -> AC1, AC2, AC3, AC5. Proof: talk to the orchestrator from the phone under the same rules.

# Decision framing
- Product framing: Not needed (prod_005, req_032)
- Architecture framing: Not needed (req_032 decided the engine)

# Links
- Product brief(s): `prod_005_crow_jarvis_layer`
- Request: `req_055_a_work_day_from_nest_without_a_terminal`
- Depends on: `item_169_core_serves_every_deck_source_as_read_only_sections`, `item_170_core_actions_on_live_sessions_and_dispatch_runs`, `item_146_section_change_stream_over_sse_with_a_polling_fallback`

- Primary task(s): `task_021_orchestrate_a_work_day_from_nest`

# Priority
- Priority: High
- Rationale: the main surface the owner asked for.

# Notes
- Owner 2026-11-10: "when i talk to the butler i want the hero to respond". Placement on Home under the holotable, transcript on Desk. Layout base: item_171 approved design D.

- Owner 2026-11-12: on the laptop Home is rarely open, so the hero must be visible while working → butler rail on every laptop screen, badge on phone.
