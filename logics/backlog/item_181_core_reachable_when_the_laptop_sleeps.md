# AI Context
- Summary: spike, then a decision: keep core and missions reachable from the phone while the laptop sleeps (tower as host, item_120) or write down the limit and show it in Nest.
- Keywords: always on, host, tower, laptop sleep, tailscale, mission host, spike
- Use when: deciding where core and missions run.
- Skip when: model or local AI choices (req_029 other parts).

# Problem
- core runs as a user unit on the laptop. Laptop asleep means Nest is dead and missions stop. A phone-first day needs core up.

# Scope
- In:
  - Spike (half a day): options are (a) tower runs core and missions (item_120), laptop syncs state; (b) laptop never sleeps on AC; (c) a small always-on proxy that queues asks and wakes the laptop (Wake-on-LAN). Measure cost, what breaks (paths, accounts, kitty sessions), data sync.
  - Owner picks with AskUserQuestion; record the decision here.
  - Nest shows "core offline since HH:MM" from the service worker when the origin fails.
- Out:
  - Building the chosen host (new item after the decision).

# Acceptance criteria
- AC1: The spike note lists each option with cost and breakage, and the owner's pick.
- AC2: Nest shows an offline banner with the last seen time when core is down.

# AC Traceability
- request-AC5 -> AC1, AC2. Proof: decided limit or path.

# Decision framing
- Product framing: Not needed
- Architecture framing: Required. Host choice changes where state lives.

# Priority
- Priority: Medium
- Rationale: can run in parallel; blocks only the "away from desk" day.
