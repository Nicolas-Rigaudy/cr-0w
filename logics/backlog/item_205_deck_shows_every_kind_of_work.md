# AI Context
- Summary: crow-deck lists read the core work feed: every kind of work with its kind and state, mission rollup, same counts as Nest.
- Keywords: crow-deck, work feed, agents, missions, rollup, TUI
- Use when: deck work lists.
- Skip when: Nest or core changes.

# Problem
- The deck builds its own agent and mission views (`agents_data.go`, `data.go`), separate from Nest.

# Scope
- In:
  - Deck data layer reads `work`; lists show kind and state with the terminal ANSI theme; mission rollup.
- Out:
  - New deck screens or layouts without rendered options first.

# Acceptance criteria
- AC1: Deck counts per state match Nest on the same core snapshot.
- AC2: Each kind shows with its label; mission items roll up.
- AC3: `go test ./...` passes in tools/crow-deck.

# Priority
- Priority: Medium
- Rationale: Terminal surface follows Nest.

# Notes
- Owner decision 2026-11-13: work = live sessions, background runs, parked sessions, MRs/PRs with CI, plus missions. Missions are an automatic optional grouping (goal, end state, delegation contract), never created by hand, never a separate list.
- Read `local/owner-prefs.md` before building. Visual changes need rendered options first.
