# AI Context
- Summary: Ease the head turn when it follows the pointer so fast left-right moves do not jitter.
- Keywords: nest, hero, head, turn, pointer, easing
- Use when: building or reviewing the Nest hero after item_158.
- Skip when: work outside the Nest hero.

# Problem
- Moving the pointer quickly from left to right makes the head snap between directions. It feels brutal and jittery.

# Scope
- In:
  - Damped follow (spring or critically damped easing) on the head yaw and pitch.
  - Hysteresis so the head does not flip back and forth near the centre.
  - Respect reduced motion.
- Out:
  - New idle animations (item_198).

# Acceptance criteria
- AC1: A fast sweep across the hero gives one smooth turn, no flicker between frames (screen recording).
- AC2: Unit test on the follow step: bounded velocity, settles without overshoot past target.
- AC3: Idle paints stay at 0 with reduced motion (`scripts/hero-idle.mjs`).

# AC Traceability
- request-AC1 -> This backlog slice. Proof: owner OK on shots.
- request-AC2 -> This backlog slice. Proof: tests and perf scripts.

# Decision framing
- Product framing: Not needed
- Architecture framing: Not needed

# Priority
- Priority: High
- Rationale: owner feedback 2026-11-12 on the item_158 build.

# Notes
- Pure motion code in src/hero/motion.ts, testable like the spin step. No design pass.
