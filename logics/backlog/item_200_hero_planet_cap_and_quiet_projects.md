# AI Context
- Summary: Decide and build how many project planets the hero table shows and how quiet projects appear.
- Keywords: hero, planets, cap, quiet, sleeping, layout
- Use when: building req_059 step 2.
- Skip when: deriving planet state (item_199).

# Problem
- 13 active projects do not fit the table at the current planet size; labels would collide with the head.

# Scope
- In:
  - Show every project with live activity, a mission or an ask; fill up to a cap with the most recent by `projects[].work` counts.
  - Quiet projects render small and dim (sleeping), no label until hover.
  - Overflow summarised on the rim (e.g. `+5 quiet`).
- Out:
  - State derivation (item_199).

# Decision framing
- Product framing: Needed. Ask the owner before building: cap value (6 / 8 / all), quiet look (small dim vs moons vs rim only). Show options side by side (bin/crow-compare) with real data.
- Architecture framing: Not needed

# Acceptance criteria
- AC1: The owner picked the cap and quiet look from side-by-side renders.
- AC2: Desktop 1440x900 and phone 368x812 renders show no label overlaps with the head or each other.
- AC3: Every live, failed or needs project is always on the table regardless of the cap.

# AC Traceability
- request-AC3 -> AC1, AC3. Proof: renders and model test.

# Progress note (2026-11-13)
- Quiet colour decided and built: grey quiet planets, working planet glows more (vault Research/nest-design/item_200/quiet-color). Still open: the 9-planet cap (live data has 14 projects).
- Working planets wear a tilted, turning ring (cbe324a). Owner OK on the motion clip (vault Research/nest-design/item_200/quiet-color/ring-motion.mp4).
