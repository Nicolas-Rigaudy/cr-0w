# AI Context
- Summary: crow checks the tools it is built on (cdx, logics-manager, Claude Code, Codex CLI, rtk) on a schedule, reads what changed since the last check, maps each change to what crow does today, and files proposals the owner decides on.
- Keywords: tool updates, changelog, cdx, logics-manager, claude code, codex, rtk, timer, ritual, upkeep
- Use when: building the watch ritual or changing which tools it follows.
- Skip when: installing or upgrading packages on the machine. That belongs to the owner's dotfiles repo.

# Needs
- The owner no longer has to ask "is there anything new in cdx or logics we should leverage". A scheduled check answers it.
- Each new release is read once. Changes that touch something crow does (a workaround, a hand-built path, a missing feature) become proposals with the crow file or Logics item they affect.
- An installed version behind the latest is visible, so the owner knows an update is due.

# Context
- 2026-11-09: a manual pass over cdx 0.26.0..0.26.11 and logics-manager 2.24.x found eight usable changes. They were filed as notes on item_116, item_133, item_136 and as item_142. This request makes that pass recurring.
- Existing pattern to reuse: `bin/crow-retro` (systemd user timer, no-model pre-filter, one batch run, dated report). See runbooks/session-retros.md.
- Machine package updates (pacman, AUR, npm globals, cdx install) move to the owner's dotfiles repo. This request only reads versions and changelogs.

# Acceptance criteria
- AC1: a tool list in `local/` (name, version command, changelog source, last version read) drives the check; adding a tool is one entry.
- AC2: a weekly timer runs a no-model pre-filter. When no followed tool has a new release, nothing else runs.
- AC3: on new releases, one run on the smallest fitting model writes a dated note in the vault crow folder: per tool, versions read, changes that matter to crow with the file or item they affect, and proposals. It never edits code.
- AC4: the brief shows the latest note while it holds open proposals. The owner picks proposals through a prompt; picked ones become Logics notes or items.
- AC5: a runbook describes the ritual and is in runbooks/README.md.
