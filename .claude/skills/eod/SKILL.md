# End of day

Main session (AskUserQuestion needs it). Goal: capture what the owner worked on that no tool recorded. Cheap: scripts pick the topics, the model only asks and files.

## 1. Pick topics (no exploration)
- `bin/crow-notes --since 3d`: tags and topics already noted (the ones with a trace are lower priority).
- `<state>/open-threads.md` (sections Me, Crow, Waiting; see `runbooks/open-threads.md`), vault `hot.md`, Jira In Progress / Merge Review (if connected), `bin/crow-activity --since today`.
- Keep the live topics (at most 3) with the least trace today: no note, no commit, no thread update.

## 2. Ask
One `AskUserQuestion` call, one question per topic, each self-contained: the topic, what is known, 3 options (e.g. progressed / blocked / not touched today) plus the free "Other". Never more than 3 questions. Nothing live, nothing asked.

## 3. File (one answer, one place)
| Answer is about | Goes to |
|---|---|
| Something done or decided | `bin/crow-note "<text> #tag" --section eod` |
| A meeting or call | `bin/crow-note "<text>" --section meetings` |
| A blocker | `bin/crow-note "<text> #blocage" --section eod` |
| A project fact | the project note under `10 Work`, appended as one bullet |
| A new open item | `<state>/open-threads.md`, one line `- [ ] YYYY-MM-DD [project] text → next step` under `## Me`, `## Crow` or `## Waiting` (Waiting starts with the person) |
| An open item now finished | remove its line from `open-threads.md` and run `bin/crow-log "[project] done: text"` |
| "Not touched" / skipped | nothing |

Rules: never write a status note into `open-threads.md`; write in the language of the note (French in the vault), short and declarative. Never edit outside the agreed sections, never rewrite existing lines, never touch another person's content. Tags: #team #naval #blocage #decision #demo (extend only when asked).

## 4. Report
Print what was written and where, one line each. Then suggest `/wrap`.
